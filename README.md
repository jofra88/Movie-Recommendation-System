Movie Recommendation System
• Preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 movie titles, effectively cleaning and vectorizing 5,000 
unique tags to enable efficient analysis and retrieval.
• Leveraged Natural Language Processing techniques using NLTK to precisely represent tags and movie 
descriptions, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the system's recommendations by refining how text data 
was interpreted and processed.
• Achieved 92% accuracy in recommendations by calculating movie similarity with cosine distance
